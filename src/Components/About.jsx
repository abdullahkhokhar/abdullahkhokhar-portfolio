                    <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/" target="_blank"> CloudFormation</a>, etc.</p>
                <p>Prior to this, I was a Full Stack Software Developer Intern part of the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/cx/marketing/automation/" target="_blank"> Oracle Eloqua Cloud</a> Organization where I contributed to the development and integration of applications (e.g. Salesforce, Facebook, Instagram) with the Marketing Cloud.</p>
